<h2> Environment </h2>

This session runs from 10:30-12:00 and focuses on exploring environmental data, interactive tools, and visualising natural disaster data. Tentative speakers are:
<br><br>

<ul>
   <li> <strong> James Goldie </strong>  <em> Talking about climate change in 7 seconds </em> 
<p> We all strive to create charts and maps that help people understand complex issues, but how do you do that when someone barely glances at your visualisation? Using audience exercises and examples, we'll look at how and when people encounter visualisations, how we communicate meaning rapidly with and without context, and how we can ensure that the "quick read" of a data visualisation lines up with the "long read". </li>
   <li> <strong> Tony North </strong> <em> Scalable interactive maps for the time poor </em> 
<p> Interactive maps are powerful visualisation tools for communicating insights to inform decision making. Map making is both an art and a science. However as map builders, we face numerous challenges. Transforming data to meaningful visuals, scaling to large spatial data, and handling additional contexts are just some of the difficulties we face when building interactive maps. We need the ability to adapt to unexpected changes to requirements, and iterate quickly as new information comes to light. However, our maps can be hampered by the limitations of our tooling, "too much information", and time constraints. In this talk, I discuss how <tt>rdeck</tt> empowers you to overcome these challenges to create meaningful interactive maps with effective visuals in a dynamic environment.</p> 
</li>
   <li> <strong> Kate Saunders </strong> <em> Doing more with data to translate weather warnings into community impacts </em> 
<p> Best practice data communication and data visualisation principles are not consistently being adopted when facilitating an emergency response. This was evident during the 2022 Eastern Australia floods, where the available data was not used optimally to translate weather forecasts into information about community impacts and individual vulnerability. It is therefore time to revisit the gold-standards for disaster communication, and to rethink how best to make use of the data about our world during a disaster event. In this talk, we will explore examples of where the data-driven communication and visualisation was lacking during the recent flooding. We will also discuss the challenges of real-time disaster communication and where there is scope to provide improved data-driven solutions. </p>
</li>
</ul>
