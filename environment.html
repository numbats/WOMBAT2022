<h2> Environment </h2>

This session runs from 10:30-12:00 and focuses on exploring environmental data, interactive tools, and visualising natural disaster data. Tentative speakers are:

<ul>
   <li> <strong> James Goldie </strong>  TBD </li>
   <li> <strong> Tony North </strong> TBD </li>
   <li> <strong> Kate Saunders </strong> <em> Doing more with data to translate weather warnings into community impacts </em> 
<p> Best practice data communication and data visualisation principles are not consistently being adopted when facilitating an emergency response. This was evident during the 2022 Eastern Australia floods, where the available data was not used optimally to translate weather forecasts into information about community impacts and individual vulnerability. It is therefore time to revisit the gold-standards for disaster communication, and to rethink how best to make use of the data about our world during a disaster event. In this talk, we will explore examples of where the data-driven communication and visualisation was lacking during the recent flooding. We will also discuss the challenges of real-time disaster communication and where there is scope to provide improved data-driven solutions. </p>
