<ul>
   <li> <strong> Casey Briggs </strong> TBD </li>
   <li> <strong> Liam Mannix </strong> <em> Model Madness: the difficulty of communicating and reporting on modelling</em> 
<p> Modelling played a key role in our pandemic response. But how effectively was it communicated to the public? As a science reporter who did most of The Age and the Sydney Morning Herald's modelling reporting, my suspicion is: very poorly. There are several reasons for this that I think can inform how we go forward both as journalists and as modellers. </p>
