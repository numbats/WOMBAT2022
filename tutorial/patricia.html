<h2> Collaborative projects with git and GitHub </h2>

<br>


<p> Government and industry organisations together with universities are embracing the notion of computational reproducibility around projects as a foundation of their working practices. It has become a basic requirement that projects be built in a reproducible manner. The aim of this workshop is to understand the importance of reproducible research and to learn how to use Git and GitHub as version control systems within the R ecosystem.

<br>
