<h2> Interactive web applications with Shiny for R </h2>

<br>

<p> <a href="https://www.mitchelloharawild.com/"> Mitchell O'Hara-Wild </a> is an award-winning teaching associate and research assistant at Monash University with particular expertise in R package development, data analysis and statistical computing. He holds a Bachelor of Commerce (Honours) with a major in econometrics, and a Bachelor of Science majoring in computational science and mathematical statistics. Mitchell is the developer of several widely used R packages and operates a data consultancy which runs workshops and provides data analysis and tools. 

<br>

<ul>
   <li> <strong> Session 1: Basics of shiny </strong> </li>
    <ul>
      <li> Overview of shiny, summarising its capabilities and use cases. </li>
      <li> Creating a user interface (ui) in R with simple inputs and outputs. </li>
      <li> Writing reactive server code to make a plot using the inputs provided. </li>
      <li> Combine these concepts and make your first shiny app. </li>
    </ul>
   <li> <strong> Session 2: Reactive programming </strong> </li>
    <ul>
      <li> Understand how shiny server code works with reactive programming. </li>
      <li> Using the building blocks for reactivity: observe() changes, reactive() objects, using input$*, render*() output and isolate() code. </li>
      <li> The how and why of validating user inputs to safely run code. </li>
    </ul>
   <li> <strong> Session 3: Publishing apps </strong> </li>
    <ul>
      <li> A brief introduction to the many shiny extension packages available. </li>
      <li> Some quick improvements to the style and appearance of our app using extension packages. </li>
      <li> Discuss options for deploying your app online, including with docker containers and the <a href="http://shinyapps.io/"> shinyapps.io</a> service </li>
    </ul>
</ul>

Participants are expected to be familiar with writing R code, but no prior experience in website development or shiny is required to get the most out of this workshop. A <a href="http://shinyapps.io/"> shinyapps.io</a> account is needed to deploy your app to <a href="http://shinyapps.io/"> shinyapps.io</a> in session 3 (but is not required if you just want to watch this part).
