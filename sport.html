<h2> Sport </h2>

This session runs from 3:00-4:30 and focuses on exploring sports data, artificial intelligence and interpreting complex sports data models.

<ul>
   <li> <strong> Analysing spatiotemporal aspects of team sports from complex sensor data</strong> <br> <em> Alice Sweeting, Sports analyst, Victoria University </em> <p> Sport is exhilarating, the highs and lows are all experienced! Data, captured from athletes competing during sporting matches and events, is also complex. In this talk, I will discuss how we can start to be curious about understanding the complexity and contextual factors in data captured during team-sport matches. Specifically, I will discuss how spatiotemporal data, captured via a wearable sensor, is typically analysed in an aggregate manner. For example, we can examine the total or sprint distance covered by a team-sport athlete. However, by layering this spatiotemporal data with contextual factors, including things happening in the athletic environment called constraints, we can start to understand and model complexity. I will give examples of how visualising and understanding this complexity is possible, through the use of R and associated packages, which can allow for greater reproducibility, automation and versatility in high performance sport. </li>
   <li> <strong> More data than we know what to do with! [Note: Women's results not available.] </strong> <br> <em> Jacquie Tran, Head of Intelligence, High Performance Sport New Zealand </em> <p> Today, for many mainstream elite and professional sports, in-depth data is available for coaches, analysts, journalists, and fans to interrogate and understand "how the game is played". But for women's sports, substantial inequities remain in terms of data availability, depth, and accuracy. In this talk, I will discuss why it matters that detailed performance data is collected in women's sports and highlight some of the people and projects that are helping to close these data gaps. </li>
   <li> <strong> Visually exploring local explanations from complex non-linear models to understand sports performance </strong> <br> <em> Di Cook, Monash University </em> <p> Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is an emerging field of methods being developed to help interpretability for complex nonlinear models, models commonly used to predict athlete performance. At the core of XAI are local explanations, which provide insight into what factors most contribute to an individual's performance score. This talk will describe how local explanations work in relation to soccer player metrics, and also how to further investigate the validity of these interpretations using visualisation. </li>
